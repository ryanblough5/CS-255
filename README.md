# CS-255

The client for this project was DriverPass. They wanted us to design to a system that would help new drivers learn the rules of the road better, as well as keep track of their progress.

I think that I did the Business Requirements part of the project particualarily well, I was able to give good explanations to what was required in the document. 

One thing I would do differently and revise is the Use Case Diagram, I feel as though I should have added more to it and explain things a little better.

It is important to consider the user's needs because they user is the one that is going to use the finished product, so while designing the system, I wanted to make sure that the end product was as user-friendly as possible.

I think that a strategy that I would use in the future is creating the diagrams in the planning phase of creating the product. They make it much easier to complete work further down the process.
